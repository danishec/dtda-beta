Monday was scorching hot!  Daphne was refilling her water bottle when she heard noises outside and glanced out the window. It was Mrs. Gable in her lovely flower garden struggling to give her golden retriever, Sunny, a bath.  Sunny was covered in soapy bubbles that he didn't seem to enjoy. He shook and wiggled with gusto, spraying soapy water on Mrs. Gable and almost on her colorful flowers nearby.  Poor Mrs. Gable was laughing, but it was a bubbly mess everywhere.

</p>

<p>
Suddenly Daphne remembered Mom saying entrepreneurs solve problems. Mrs. Gable definitely had a problem â€“ a slippery, soapy, wiggling dog who needed a bath in the scorching sun!  Daphne skipped outside and called out, "Mrs. Gable, need a hand with Sunny's bath?  Entrepreneurs solve problems, and maybe two sets of hands are better than one for a soapy dog!"

</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gable looked up, soapy water dripping from her nose, and burst out laughing. "Oh, Daphne, you are an angel!  Yes, please! Sunny is being extra wiggly today."

</p>

<p>
With Daphne's help, Mrs. Gable got Sunny clean and dry in no time. After putting away all the drenched towels, Mrs. Gable said with relief, "Thank you Daphne! It would have taken me all morning to get Sunny clean.  How can I reward you for your help?"

</p>

<p>
Daphne thought for a moment, looking around Mrs. Gable's beautiful garden. Entrepreneurs solve problems AND sometimes get money, but money is used to buy things so can't an entrepreneur get things in return?

</p>

<p>
What should Daphne ask for?
