Wednesday morning, Daphne and Dad carried a little table out to the front yard.  Daphne covered the table with the picnic blanket Dad gave her, and carefully setup the lemonade cups and pitcher.  She and Dad then put up her sign facing the street where everyone could see it.

</p>

<p>
Then she waited.  And waited.  She peeked out to the street, feeling a mixture of excitement bubbling up and butterflies fluttering in her tummy.  Would anyone come?  What if nobody wanted her lemonade?  

</p>

<p>
Just when Daphne started to think maybe lemonade wasn't such a super idea...  someone called out "One super lemonade, please!" It was Mrs. Gable with Sunny trotting happily beside her.  Mrs. Gable winked, handing Daphne a dollar.

</p>

<p>
Soon, it wasn't just Mrs. Gable!  The morning got warmer, and people started strolling by.  A friendly mailman stopped for a cup, then a neighbor out for a morning walk, then a couple pushing a baby stroller!  "Best lemonade on the block!" one neighbor called out with a smile.  Each time someone bought a lemonade, Daphne's smile grew wider.

</p>

<p>
By lunchtime, Daphne had sold NINE whole cups of lemonade!  She carefully poured the very last cup, not for a customer, but for someone extra special â€“ her brother, Daiyan!  She knew he'd love a cool lemonade after playing outside.

</p>

<p>
Daphne counted her earnings.  Nine dollars!  Plus, Mom gave her a bright red "Sharing is Caring" sticker and Daiyan gave her a big hug!  Daphne was a Lemonade Entrepreneur!
