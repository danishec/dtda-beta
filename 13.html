Daphne took a deep breath.  Talking to strangers felt a little scary, but she was a brave entrepreneur!  She approached five kids playing in the park. She showed them one of the beautiful roses Mrs. Gabel gave her, and described a pretty flower hair clip she could make. "If I made it really pretty, would you buy one for $2?" she asked each kid.

</p>

<p>
Kid 1: "So pretty!  But I like headbands not clips."
Kid 2: "Maybe... ask my Mommy."
Mommy: "Yes dear. We would buy one. What a creative idea!"
Kid 3: "YES! I would love a flower in my hair!"
Kid 4: "Want to play catch with me?"
Kid 5: "Maybe for $1. $2 is too much."

</p>

<p>
Daphne learned that some kids liked the idea, but $2 might be too much, and not everyone was interested in hair clips.  With the market research done, she rushed home and, with Mom's help, used some of her $10 to buy hair clips and glue. Daphne opted for the cheaper black clips which were $2 and glue which was $1. 

</p>

<p>
She carefully glued the roses onto the clips, making 10 pretty flower hair clips, ready to sell!

</p>

<p>
Daphne earned a Market Research sticker!
