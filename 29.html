Saturday morning sunshine streamed into Daphne's room and onto Daphne's toy box!  It was an overflowing mess!  Dad poked his head in, surveying the toy chaos with a smile. "Morning, Daphne!  Looks like your toy box needs some help" he laughed.  "Maybe it's time for a toy clear-out?  You could sell some of your old toys.  Make some space some money!  You could probably get about $1 for each one."

</p>

<p>
Daphne started sorting through the toy box.  There was an old spirograph.. All the wheels were still there. It just needed a fresh set of markers. Then there was the puzzle Dadima gave her last Christmas. And Pixel, her stuffed chameleon.  But then, her mind drifted the new Rainbow Unicorn Hula Hoop that was just released.  Twirling with that would be so much fun!  To get it, she'd have to say goodbye to some of her toy treasures...  Tough choice!

</p>

<p>
What should Daphne do?
