You truly are a natural entrepreneur!  You showed creativity in solving the challenges that came up, and you learned about the value of money!"</p><p>Mom added, "We are incredibly proud of you, Daphne. You were eager to be successful and made smart decisions.  You've earned your 'Entrepreneur' sticker!"</p><p>Daphne beamed, feeling a huge sense of accomplishment.

She couldn't wait for her next adventure!</p>`;

She learned that sometimes, success is all about trying new things.  And she definitely had new ideas for the next Entrepreneur Adventure!</p>`;
